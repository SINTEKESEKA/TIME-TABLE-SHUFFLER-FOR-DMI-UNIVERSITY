# TIME-TABLE-SHUFFLER-FOR-DMI-UNIVERSITY WEB APP
To create a web application-based timetable shuffler for DMI University, which incorporates different user roles with varied access permissions and views, we can follow a structured plan. We will use React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB (or any database of your choice) for data storage.
